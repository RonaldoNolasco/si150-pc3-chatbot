What is artificial intelligence?
Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionality. 



Non-historians may assume that time periods are fixed and absolute, whereas historians have various ways of organizing history thematically and chronologically. Periodization, to historians, is just a convenient form of broad organization, especially useful for course listings in university catalogs and subject headings in library catalogs.

History is the study of the past – specifically the people, societies, events and problems of the past – as well as our attempts to understand them. It is a pursuit common to all human societies.
